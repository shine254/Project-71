                choices.Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a school Canteen Account on the 
                school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online
                by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss money handling,making it safer and less
